# Crime-Analysis-Prediction

The project involves data mining algorithms used to mine patterns and trends in the occurrence of crimes in any city, with respect to day of a week,time of the day and place in a city.

Programming Language: JAVA

Algorithms Used:

*Kernel Density Estimation
*Robust Clustering Algorithm for Categorical Attributes
*K-Medoid Clustering Algorithm

Achieved an overall precision of 72% in predicting criminal activities, with respect to a particular time frame of the day, day of a week and identifying a vulnerable locality in the city.
